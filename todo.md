### Overview of the Solution:
- **Public Subnet VM**: Hosts the IIS web application for **myinsider** and **upsi** projects.
- **Private Subnet VM**: Hosts the database (e.g., SQL Server) used by the web applications.
- **Communication**: The web application in the public subnet will securely communicate with the database in the private subnet.

### Steps to Achieve This:

---

### 1. **Create a Virtual Network (VNet)**

First, you'll need to create a Virtual Network (VNet) to isolate and securely connect both the **public subnet** and **private subnet**.

#### Steps to Create VNet:
1. **Log in to the Azure Portal** using your company’s credentials.
2. Navigate to **Create a Resource** > **Networking** > **Virtual Network**.
3. Fill in the basic details:
   - **Subscription**: Your company’s Azure subscription.
   - **Resource Group**: Create a new or select an existing one.
   - **Name**: Provide a name for the VNet, such as `MyVNet`.
   - **Region**: Select a region that fits your company’s requirements.

4. Under **Address Space**:
   - Set the address space (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`) for the VNet.

5. **Create Subnets**:
   - **Public Subnet**: Set an address range like `10.0.1.0/24`.
   - **Private Subnet**: Set an address range like `10.0.2.0/24`.
   
6. **Review and Create** the VNet.

### 2. **Create Network Security Groups (NSG)**

You need to configure **NSGs** to control the traffic to and from your VMs.

#### For the **Public Subnet NSG**:
- Allow inbound HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443) traffic from the internet to the IIS server.
- Allow inbound RDP (port 3389) or SSH (port 22) for administrative access.

#### For the **Private Subnet NSG**:
- Allow traffic from the Public Subnet’s IP range to the database port (e.g., SQL Server port 1433).
- Block inbound internet traffic to the Private Subnet (this is the default behavior).
- Allow outbound traffic to the Public Subnet for communication purposes.

### 3. **Create Virtual Machines (VMs)**

You need to create two **VMs**:
- One in the **Public Subnet** to deploy your IIS-hosted .NET application.
- One in the **Private Subnet** to host your database (e.g., SQL Server).

#### For the **Public Subnet VM** (IIS):
1. **Go to Create a Resource** > **Compute** > **Virtual Machine**.
2. Choose the **VM size** based on your needs.
3. **Networking**:
   - Under **Virtual Network**, select the VNet you created.
   - Choose the **Public Subnet**.
   - Assign a **Public IP** (either Dynamic or Static).
   - Select **Network Security Group** with appropriate inbound/outbound rules as discussed above.

#### For the **Private Subnet VM** (Database):
1. Create another **VM** following the same steps.
2. This time, choose the **Private Subnet** for the network.
3. Ensure that **no public IP** is assigned, as this server will be accessed privately.

### 4. **Deploy the IIS Web Application**

After creating the VM in the **Public Subnet**, you need to deploy your .NET web application to IIS.

1. **Connect to the Public Subnet VM** via **RDP**.
2. **Install IIS** and the necessary **.NET Framework** if not already installed:
   - Go to **Server Manager** > **Manage** > **Add Roles and Features**.
   - Select **Web Server (IIS)** and the required .NET features (e.g., **ASP.NET**, **.NET Framework**).
   
3. **Publish your .NET application**:
   - In Visual Studio, **publish** your .NET web application to a folder.
   - Copy the published files to your **VM** (via RDP, FTP, or using **Azure Storage**).
   
4. **Configure IIS** to host the .NET application:
   - Open **IIS Manager**.
   - Create a new **Website** with the path pointing to the folder where your .NET application is stored.
   - Bind the website to the desired port (80 or 8080).
   - Ensure the application pool is set to use the correct .NET version.

### 5. **Deploy the Database (SQL Server)**

For the **Private Subnet VM**, you can deploy a database like SQL Server to store data for your application.

1. **Connect to the Private Subnet VM** via **RDP**.
2. **Install SQL Server** or any other required database management system.
   - Download and install **SQL Server** or use an existing Azure Database service like **Azure SQL Database** if appropriate.

3. **Configure Database Connectivity**:
   - Create the necessary database schemas and tables for the **myinsider** and **upsi** applications.
   - Set up **SQL Server authentication** (username/password) or **Windows Authentication** based on your security requirements.

---

### 6. **Configure Communication Between the Web Application and Database**

Now, you need to configure your IIS-hosted application to securely communicate with the database hosted on the Private Subnet VM.

#### Steps:
1. **Find the Private IP of the Database VM**:
   - Go to **Azure Portal** > **Virtual Machines** > Select your Private Subnet VM.
   - Get the **Private IP Address** (e.g., `10.0.2.4`).

2. **Configure the Web Application**:
   - In your **web.config** file (or equivalent configuration), update the connection string to point to the **Private IP** of the database VM.
   
   Example connection string:
   ```xml
   <connectionStrings>
      <add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Server=10.0.2.4,1433;Database=myDatabase;User Id=myUser;Password=myPassword;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
   </connectionStrings>
   ```

3. **Ensure Communication**:
   - The **Public Subnet VM** should be able to connect to the **Private Subnet VM** on the database port (usually **1433** for SQL Server).
   - Check if the **Private Subnet VM** has **Network Security Group** rules that allow inbound connections from the **Public Subnet**'s IP range to port **1433**.

4. **Test Connectivity**:
   - From the **Public Subnet VM**, you can test the connection to the database using tools like **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** or by attempting to connect via the .NET application itself.

---

### 7. **Security Considerations**

- **NSG (Network Security Group)**: Make sure that the **Public Subnet VM** is only accessible on necessary ports (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS, port 80/443) from external sources, and the **Private Subnet VM** has restricted access (only from the Public Subnet).
- **Database Authentication**: Use secure authentication methods (e.g., SQL Server authentication with strong passwords).
- **Firewalls**: Ensure that both VMs have Windows Firewall rules that allow necessary communication (especially for database access between VMs).

---

### 8. **DNS Configuration (Optional)**

To use a domain name for your IIS web application, you can set up a DNS record pointing to the **Public IP** of the **Public Subnet VM**.

1. In **Azure**, you can assign a **DNS label** to the **Public IP** (e.g., `myapp.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com`).
2. If using a custom domain (e.g., `www.myapp.com`), configure an **A Record** to point to the **Public IP**.

---

### Final Notes:
- **Public Subnet VM**: This VM hosts the IIS application, accessible via a public IP or custom domain.
- **Private Subnet VM**: This VM holds the database, not directly accessible from the public internet.
- The **Public Subnet VM** can communicate with the **Private Subnet VM** using internal Azure IPs (private IPs), ensuring security and isolation of the database.
- Ensure that your NSG and firewall rules are configured properly to secure both VMs.

Following these steps will help you create a secure and functional setup where your IIS-hosted application communicates with the database inside a private subnet. Let me know if you need further clarification on any of the steps!
