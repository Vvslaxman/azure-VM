### 1. **Create Virtual Network (VNet) with Public and Private Subnets**

#### **Why:**
- **Virtual Network (VNet)** is the foundation for networking in Azure. It allows you to control communication between resources and ensures isolation between different environments (e.g., web application and database).
- **Public and Private Subnets** offer separation of resources based on exposure to the internet. The web-facing app resides in the **public subnet**, while the database remains isolated in the **private subnet** to reduce security risks.

#### **Detailed Steps:**
- **Create a VNet** with address space `10.0.0.0/16`. This address range will provide flexibility for subnetting.
- **Create two subnets**:
  - **Public Subnet** (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24`): This subnet will host resources like your IIS web server that must be accessible from the public internet.
  - **Private Subnet** (e.g., `10.0.2.0/24`): This subnet will host resources that should not be exposed to the internet, such as your database server.

#### **Best Practices:**
- Use **subnet segmentation** to isolate workloads. It reduces the blast radius in case of a security breach.
- Ensure that **private subnets** do not have direct access to the internet, and limit exposure to only those resources that need it.
- Enable **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** on each subnet to control traffic flow at the subnet and VM levels.

---

### 2. **Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to Control Traffic**

#### **Why:**
- **NSGs** are essential for controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet or VM network interface level. It allows you to enforce security policies on each subnet and virtual machine.
- Properly configuring NSGs helps in reducing the attack surface by allowing only necessary traffic.

#### **Detailed Steps:**
- **Public Subnet NSG**:
  - **Allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443)** to allow inbound traffic for the IIS web server.
  - Allow **RDP (port 3389)** or **SSH (port 22)** access to the web server but restrict it to trusted IPs (e.g., your office IP or VPN).
  - **Deny** inbound traffic to all other ports from the internet, ensuring that only the required services are exposed.
  
- **Private Subnet NSG**:
  - **Allow traffic from Public Subnet**: Permit only traffic on the database port (e.g., port 1433 for SQL Server).
  - **Deny** inbound traffic from external IPs to the database, ensuring it is only accessible from the public subnet.
  - **Allow outbound traffic to the public subnet** for communication (e.g., SQL database connectivity).

#### **Best Practices:**
- Apply **NSGs on both the subnet and individual VMs** to ensure traffic filtering at all levels.
- Continuously audit and update NSG rules to follow the **least privilege** principle, allowing only necessary access.
- Regularly review inbound and outbound traffic rules.

### 3. **Limit Public IP Exposure to Web Application (IIS Server)**

#### **Why:**
- Exposing VMs directly to the internet with public IPs increases the attack surface for your infrastructure. Only the necessary components should be exposed to the public internet (e.g., web servers).

#### **Detailed Steps:**
- **Assign a Public IP only to the IIS web server** (located in the public subnet).
- **Do not assign a public IP to the database server** in the private subnet. Instead, use a **Private IP** for communication between the application and the database.
  
#### **Best Practices:**
- If scaling your application is necessary, consider using an **Azure Load Balancer** or **Application Gateway** to distribute traffic among multiple VMs.
- Use **Azure Application Gateway** with a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to add additional security features, such as DDoS protection and centralized monitoring for threats.

### 4. **Use Azure Bastion for Secure Remote Access**

#### **Why:**
- **Azure Bastion** enables **secure RDP and SSH** access to your VMs without exposing them to the public internet. This reduces the risks associated with open RDP/SSH ports.
  
#### **Detailed Steps:**
- **Deploy Azure Bastion** to provide secure access to both the **public and private subnet VMs**.
- **Bastion Host** allows you to securely connect to your VMs over RDP or SSH directly from the Azure portal without needing to configure public IPs or manage complex VPN connections.

#### **Best Practices:**
- Use **Bastion for managing VMs** in both public and private subnets. This ensures that remote access is secure and doesn’t require open ports.
- Disable **direct RDP/SSH access** to VMs from the public internet.

---

### 5. **Database Communication over Private IP**

#### **Why:**
- The **database server** should not be directly exposed to the internet for security reasons. Communicating over private IPs ensures that all traffic between the application and the database remains within the secure Azure network.
- **Private IPs** offer higher security and performance by ensuring that data never traverses the public internet.

#### **Detailed Steps:**
- **Configure your application** to communicate with the database using the **Private IP** of the database server. For example:
  - `Server=10.0.2.4; Database=mydb; User Id=myuser; Password=mypassword;`
- Ensure that the **application server in the public subnet** is able to connect to the **database server in the private subnet** via **private IP**.

#### **Best Practices:**
- Avoid using **public IPs** for any internal resources like databases or backend services.
- Use **service endpoints** or **Private Link** if using Azure-managed databases (Azure SQL Database, Azure PostgreSQL, etc.) to ensure that the connection happens over private links.

### 6. **Use Azure SQL Database (or Managed Service) for the Database**

#### **Why:**
- **Azure SQL Database** and other **managed services** like **Azure PostgreSQL** or **Azure MySQL** are designed for cloud environments. They handle **patching, scaling, backup, and security** without you having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
- Managed databases provide features like **automatic backups, high availability, automatic scaling**, and **security features** like encryption and firewalls.

#### **Detailed Steps:**
- For SQL Server, opt for **Azure SQL Database** or **SQL Managed Instance**, which are highly available, scalable, and fully managed.
- **Configure backups**: Use automated backup features to ensure your data is protected and can be restored in case of failure.
- **Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** to encrypt data at rest.
- Configure **firewalls and virtual network rules** to only allow connections from your VNet or specific subnets.

#### **Best Practices:**
- Prefer **Azure-managed databases** over installing SQL Server or MySQL on VMs. This reduces the administrative burden and improves performance and security.
- Enable **high availability features** like **Geo-Replication** or **Failover Groups** for critical workloads.

### 7. **Use Virtual Network Service Endpoints or Private Link**

#### **Why:**
- **Service Endpoints** and **Private Link** provide secure, **private access** to Azure services like Azure SQL Database over your VNet, ensuring that the traffic does not traverse the public internet. This improves security and reliability.

#### **Detailed Steps:**
- **Enable Virtual Network Service Endpoints** for Azure SQL Database to ensure that traffic between your application and database stays within the Azure backbone network.
- Alternatively, use **Azure Private Link** to provide private, secure connections to PaaS services like Azure SQL Database.

#### **Best Practices:**
- Use **Service Endpoints** or **Private Link** to enhance security for database communications.
- Disable public access to Azure SQL Database if you are using **Private Link**.

### 8. **Implement Monitoring and Alerts**

#### **Why:**
- **Monitoring and alerting** are crucial to detect issues like performance degradation, security breaches, and operational failures early. Proactive monitoring helps maintain a healthy infrastructure.

#### **Detailed Steps:**
- Use **Azure Monitor** to gather logs and metrics for both VMs and database resources.
- Set up **alerts** based on specific thresholds, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, failed login attempts, and high network traffic.
- Use **Azure Log Analytics** to query and analyze logs from different Azure resources and create custom alerts for anomalies.

#### **Best Practices:**
- Set up **centralized logging** with **Azure Log Analytics** and **Azure Application Insights** for your web application.
- Configure alerts to notify administrators when critical thresholds are reached, such as **CPU usage over 80%** or **failed login attempts**.

### 9. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**

#### **Why:**
- Regular backups and disaster recovery plans are essential to protect against data loss, hardware failures, and human error.

#### **Detailed Steps:**
- Use **Azure Backup** to automatically back up VMs and databases. Ensure that your backup strategy includes regular intervals for data protection.
- Use **Azure Site Recovery** for VM replication to another region to ensure disaster recovery.
- Test backup restoration **regularly** to ensure that recovery is possible in case of failure.

#### **Best Practices:**
- Set up **geo-replication** for database and VM backups for high availability and disaster recovery.
- Use **Azure Site Recovery** to replicate VMs and ensure that your infrastructure can failover to another region.

### 10. **Scalability and High Availability**

#### **Why:**
- **Scalability** ensures that your infrastructure can handle growing traffic, while **high availability (HA)** ensures your application remains available during failures.

#### **Detailed Steps:**
- Use **Azure Load Balancer** or **Application Gateway** to distribute traffic to multiple VMs for horizontal scaling in the public subnet.
- Use **Availability Sets** or **Availability Zones** for your VMs to ensure high availability in case of hardware failure or zone failure.
- Enable **auto-scaling** for the IIS server based on traffic loads.

#### **Best Practices:**
- Use **Availability Zones** for fault tolerance at the **data center level**.
- Scale your application horizontally by adding more IIS VMs behind a **Load Balancer**.
